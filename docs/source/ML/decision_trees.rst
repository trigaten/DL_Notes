Decision Trees
==================

Decision Tree from known features 
-----------------------------------

The idea of the decision tree is that you select a feature, split your 
data according to their label on this feature then recursively do that.

Ways to split 
---------------
* Select feature based on its independent classification accuracy (at this point in 
the tree, so conditioned on the data it is given)

* Select feature based on lowest entropy



* How many possible trees are there with n features
